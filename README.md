# Maths for Big Data
In this repository I share with you some Advanced Data Analysis and popular Basic AI algorithms. \
I made this on 2019-2020 during my Master Degree on Modelling. UAB - University Master's Degree in Modelling for Science and Engineering \
Unfortunately, I have not been able to recover the code files but just the reports. Fortunately, some code can still be found at the Annex of the following pdfs. 


1. On MBD_TDA.pdf, one can find some techniques of **topological data analysis** using persistence diagrams (R code in the Annex)
2. On MBD_TreeR.pdf, one can find how to build an understand a basic **Tree classifier** using R (with some code ad the Annex)
3. On MBD_Textmining.pdf, one can find very basic **NLP** techniques to build a Bag of Words model. 
4. On MBD_stock_paper_summary, one can find a brief summary of the paper: _Schumaker, R. P. and Chen, H. (2009). Textual analysis of stock market prediction using breaking
financial news: The azfin text system. ACM Trans. Inf. Syst., 27(2)._
